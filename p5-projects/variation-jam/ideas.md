ideas for variation jam

project guidelines: Objectives
Deploying the full set of programming skills covered in the course, including arrays, loops, and data-structures.
Understanding how a basic underlying experience can be made distinctive through different programming approaches
Creating a more polished work that could be part of a portfolio
Brief
Start with an existing very simple experience - this can be either a fleshed out example from the course (including Frogsfrogsfrog if desired) or something you come up with yourself. Create a minimum of three (but ideally more) distinct variations on the experience (if you create your own experience from scratch, that will count as one of the three).

Consider work like PONGS, SNAKISMS, and Chesses to get a sense of what this could mean (though your underlying system may be simpler than these).

Feel free to borrow from any of the example code youâ€™ve seen so far in the course, but make sure to attribute in your README.md and/or your script.js.

IDEAS:
- create variations of initial cat game? (cat interact haha rhymes)
    - play w cat
    - cat dress up 

- interactive map of constelations and their meanings
    - how to create variations...
        -visual- based vs text-based vs storytelling based?

- one story but from three different character pov of same game?
