## Description

Welcome to the observatory!

Something strange has happened in the universe and itâ€™s caused the constellations in the sky to get scrambled!

We need your help to put the stars all back into place and restore the universe. 

So first, visitor, please share with the universe to locate the constellations for you to restore. 

Controls:

-Use your arrow keys to explore the observatory's telecscope and explore the night sky!

-Realign the misaligned stars, marked in red, by clicking and dragging into their place upon which the star will turn green. 

-Once you've completed the constellation correctly exploring to find the others to return the melody of the constellations!
