        -> num of flies is doubled
        -> frog's size doubles
        -> turn a poisonous fly into a regular fly/or maybe on rare occasion a golden one
    -> but be careful! within the swarms there are poisonous flies that make your health drop and you lose all your flies if accidentally eaten

    -> frog health bar?
