more ideas for frog mods

- flies eaten counter
    - when a fly is eaten the counter increases by one and displays text spawned at the site of the fly such as: 
       normal fly: yum!
            frog caught a fly!
            - one fly counts for 1 point and raises health by half a heart
       extra tasty big fly: extra tasty!
            frog is very pleased!
            - one x-fly counts for 3 reg flies and raises heart by 
       poisonous imitation fly (aka bomb): yuck!
            frog caught a poisonous fly!

        miss mechanism
            every time frog attempts to catch a fly it will either catch or miss it
                frog missed the fly!
                - unsure how it would work but this mechanic would apply to all types of flies so there's also the chance to miss a p-fly if frog tongue accidentally catches it 
            
- special flies (good/bad)
- hunger bar? the hungrier the frog the faster its tongue moves
- goal: eat x number of flies without hitting a "bomb" fly
- hearts for health, like a 3 strikes and out if you hit too many bombs
    - 3 hearts stage: frog appears happy/normal
    - 2 hearts: frog's appearance grows weary
        frog is tired
    - 1 heart: frog looks almost defeated
        warning: frog needs sustenance to heal!
    - 0 hearts: frog is ghostly spirit
        unfortunately frog will never recover finacially from this lol



        simplified frog game mechanics:
        - pond
            - start with small frog

    opposite where you play as a fly trying to escape the tongue?
    different lvls of difficulty for the fly:
    - bigger tongue, more tongues/frogs, faster tongues?
    - every pond is like a different puzzle to get through as the fly progressively getting more difficult (maybe 3-5 lvls)
    - between lvls 1 through x lvls is a progress bar and "score"
    - fly has 3 hearts to get through all the lvls
    -counter of escapes from each frog
