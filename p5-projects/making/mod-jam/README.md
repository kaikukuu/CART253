# Mod Jam: The fly's vengeance
Initial game code provided by Pippin Barr
Modded by: Kaisa Catt

A game about a fly escaping frogs in a swamp and reclaiming the fly king's crown.

Honestly I bit off a lot more than I could chew for this project so even though certain parts aren't implemented fully I hope I can demonstrate they are in progress.
