# Mod Jam: The fly's vengeance
Initial game code provided by Pippin Barr
Modded by: Kaisa Catt

A game about a fly escaping frogs in a swamp and reclaiming the fly king's crown. Use arrow keys to navigate the fly accross the swamp while avoiding hungry frogs on lilypads.

Honestly I bit off a lot more than I could chew for this project so even though certain parts aren't implemented and it's a 'rough draft' I hope I can demonstrate my learning and creativity are in progress. I wish I had more time to dedicate to this anf despite giving all I had now to it I can't help but feel disappointed that my true 'effort' may not translate.
